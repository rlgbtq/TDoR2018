# Data Index

Below is information about useful datasets. Please share any datasets you believe will be helpful for the TDoR Datathon.

## [Anna-Jayne's Machine Readable TDoR Dataset](https://bitbucket.org/annajayne/tdor_data/src/default/)
This repository holds raw data on deaths of transgender people by violence, suicide etc. as presented by [tdor.translivesmatter.info](tdor.translivesmatter.info). For each TDoR year, CSV files are provided for each month, and a folder of photos of victims where known.

## Keywords

The file `keywords.csv` contains a set of keywords that we aim to translate to different languages.

### CONTRIBUTING

We welcome translations from people who are fluent in the target language. Please do not submit a machine translation, a dictionary translation or a translation for a language you are not fluent in, as we are aiming for high quality translations that reflect the equivalent words that would be used in practice (in online media, social media, etc).

View `keywords.csv` on Github to check if the languages you are fluent in have been covered (if you click on `keywords.csv` above, you can view the file as an HTML table). If you can contribute a missing translation, please follow the instructions below. If you want to contribute a translation for a language that is not listed, please raise this on the issue page: https://github.com/rlgbtq/TDoR2018/issues/14.

**If you have a GitHub account and know how to clone a GitHub repository**, please make a pull request:

1. Fork a copy of rlgbtq/TDoR2018 to your own GitHub account, by clicking on the `Fork` button in the top-right corner of this page.

2. Clone the forked repo on your account to your local computer. As this repo is a simple data repo at present, 
there is no need to create a branch to make your changes, you can work on the master branch.

3. Open `keywords.csv` and add your translation to the relevant column. Double-check you are in the right column and your translation matches the English word/phrase on the same row in the first column. Save your changes.

4. Ideally make one commit for all keywords of one target language.

5. Push the changes to GitHub.

6. On GitHub, go to the forked repo. Click `New pull request`. GitHub will show the changes you have made. Check everything looks right, edit the message if necessary, then click `Create pull request`. One of the team will review your pull request and hopefully merge in - it may take a fews days!

**If you're not familiar with GitHub** and 

- you have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/rlgbtq/TDoR2018/issues/14 and add the translation as a comment
- you don't have a GitHub account, email the translation to rowforwards@gmail.com.

Make sure it is clear how the words in the target language correspond to the English keywords!
